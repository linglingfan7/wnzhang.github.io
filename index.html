Optimal Bidder in RTB Display Advertising
</h1>
</DIV>


<P>
<a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/w.zhang/">Weinan Zhang</a> is a third-year PhD student on computer science in Univeristy College London. The optimal bidder in real-time bidding (RTB) based display advertising is his prime research project. This research includes the optimisation on different components of the demand-side platforms (DSPs), such as the bid strategy optimisation, click-through rate/conversion rate estimation, bid landscape forecasting, budget pacing and frequency capping. Furthermore, there are some advanced topics including statistical arbitrage bidding models, feedback control bidding systems etc.
<P>
In 2013, Weinan and his colleage Shuai participated <a href="http://contest.ipinyou.com/session-three-online-leaderboard.html">iPinYou global RTB algorithm competetion</a> and won the champion in the final season. During the online stage of the competetion, Weinan found there is a huge gap between the academic research and the industrial practice, which is mainly caused by the lack of the "sensitive" advertising data and online experiment platform for university researchers. In order to bridge the academic research and industrial production, in 2014 Weinan started to build an open sourced DSP, called <a href="http://openbidder.com">OpenBidder</a>, with his colleages Xuyang, Tianxiong and Yifei at UCL.
<p>
Weinan also organises <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Computational-Advertising-Behaviour-Targeting-Group/"> London computational & behaviour targeting meetup group</a>, which gathers the professional people in London to explore the frontier of online advertising technologies.
